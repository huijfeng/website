# Biography
Iâ€™m a postdoctoral research scientist in the [Zhang Lab](https://zhanglab.c2b2.columbia.edu/index.php/Main_Page) at the [Department of Systems Biology](https://systemsbiology.columbia.edu/), the [Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics](https://www.biochem.cumc.columbia.edu/), and the [Motor Neuron Center](http://columbiamnc.org/) at Columbia University Medical Center. My primary research interests are understanding RNA biology using bioinformatics and machining learning methods in development and disease context. I currently focus on studying the mechanisms of RNA splicing and its regulation in neuronal subtype specification by integrating multiple types of high throughput sequencing data such as RNA-Seq and CLIP-Seq data.
